### Project Title  
**SonicWalk: A Sound Map Experience in Seattle Parks**

---

### Project Objectives

SonicWalk is an interactive sound map that allows people to explore Seattle parks through ambient sound. Combining walking with listening, the app invites users to slow down, reflect, and rediscover public spaces through the richness of everyday soundscapes — birds, leaves, laughter, water, dogs, and urban echoes. It brings a layer of memory, emotion, and storytelling to outdoor movement.

###  Key Deliverables

- A digital sound map of selected Seattle parks (e.g., Volunteer Park, Gas Works, Discovery Park)  
- Custom interface that lets users “walk” by tapping or following GPS  
- Embedded audio clips recorded on location (field recordings, personal stories, ambient sounds)  
- Option for users to upload their own recordings or reflections  
- GitHub repo with code and sound design system  
- A final PDF with project goals, design sketches, and sound samples

### Special Constraints

- Must ensure accessibility (for example, transcripts or captions of sound)  
- Should not collect personal location data without consent  
- All user-contributed content must follow content guidelines (no hate, no inappropriate audio)  
- Needs to comply with local park audio recording permissions if published

### Expected Outcome

An emotional and immersive sound-based walking experience that transforms how people experience parks. SonicWalk helps users reconnect with the environment, discover overlooked sonic beauty, and even reflect on their own pace of life in the city.
